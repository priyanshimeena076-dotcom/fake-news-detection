## 📝 Cover Letter / Interview Talking Points

### Opening Pitch (30 seconds)
```
"I developed an AI-powered web application that detects fake news and analyzes sentiment 
in real-time. The app uses machine learning to classify news as real or fake with 80%+ accuracy, 
explains why using explainable AI, and provides comprehensive sentiment analysis. It's deployed 
on Streamlit Cloud and processes batch requests with interactive visualizations."
```

### Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)
```
"The project uses a scikit-learn pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression 
for the fake news detection model. For sentiment analysis, I implemented both TextBlob for 
polarity/subjectivity and a custom emotion detection algorithm that breaks down emotions into 
9 categories normalized to sum to 100%.

The frontend is built with Streamlit, which provided rapid development and deployment. I used 
Plotly for interactive charts - probability bars, confidence gauges, and emotion pie charts. 
The app supports batch processing from CSV files and exports results back as CSV.

I deployed it on Streamlit Cloud, which auto-deploys from GitHub every time I push code. 
The full stack is containerized with proper dependency management."
```

### Challenges Overcome (2 minutes)
```
"One challenge was ensuring all emotion scores normalized correctly to 100%. I solved this by:
1. Individual emotion calculation with polarity/subjectivity inputs
2. Summing all emotions
3. Dividing each by total to normalize
4. Rounding to 4 decimals for precision

Another challenge was making the graph axes display correct percentages instead of decimals. 
I fixed this by adjusting the Plotly y-axis configuration to display 0-100% with proper formatting.

The third challenge was making it mobile-responsive, which Streamlit mostly handles automatically, 
but I optimized chart sizes and layout for smaller screens."
```

### Why You Built It (2 minutes)
```
"I built this to address the problem of misinformation spread. As social media amplifies 
unverified content, I wanted to create a tool that could:
1. Automatically detect potentially fake news
2. Explain its reasoning (explainable AI)
3. Analyze the sentiment and emotional tone
4. Process bulk texts efficiently

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills: data science (ML models), 
backend (Python, data processing), frontend (UI/UX), and DevOps (Git, cloud deployment)."
